# flightSimControlsRaspberryPi
programming w/python and wiring flight sim controls to work with the raspberry pi 


This program is being tested with x-plane 11.  Quite possibly will need to be adjusted to work with other flight sims also home built components could be different as well.  Please use caution using this as this is my first coding project and the project is just starting 10/14/17

To get x-plane11 to talk to the initial start up file please install the ext plane plugin from https://github.com/vranki/ExtPlane

currently only working in python 2
